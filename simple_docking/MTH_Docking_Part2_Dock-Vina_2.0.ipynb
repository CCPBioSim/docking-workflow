    "This procedure for understanding the amazing phenomenon of molecular recognition between biomolecules has been designed with a strong agenda. We believe that including the effect of biomolecular dynamics is key to improving our ability to make predictions about how biomolecules will interact. We can see these multiple conformational states either using NMR or cryo-EM experiments, or assessing the diversity of X-ray crystal structures, or using theoretical tools such as atomistic molecular dynamics. You will therefore (we hope!!) include a number of protein structures in your \"receptor\" directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "How drugs bind to multiple protein conformations depends upon the underlying physics and chemistry of proteins. In a real biological context (*in vivo*), of course, this will also depend on the environment of the protein - e.g. whether it located in a large complex or in a membrane environment. For molecules to be orally bioavailable drugs, there are more stringent criteria (e.g. Lipinski's rule of 5). \n",
    "\n",
    "Thermal fluctuations (physics) drive conformational changes, but within the constraints imposed by the chemical structure of the proteins and the ligands. The requirement for the drug to reach the target site imposes additional criteria which depend on the physicochemical properties (e.g. clogP). Other considerations, such as the specificity of the compound, its toxicity (related to specificity), synthetic accessibilty (e.g. can a chemist make it) and ease of formulation (e.g. can this be made into a safe and effective medicine, and is it feasible to make large quantities of it) are essential in practise, and can be non-trivial to overcome.   \n",

    "In this part we also take our docking results and do a few further things:\n",
    "- We calculate interactions between the ligands and the protein\n",
    "- We produce some .sdf files that we can use with other chemoinformatics software (e.g. DataWarrior)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of features to protein-ligand interactions that we can quantify and use to identify our 'best' or most promising compounds. Here is a list of the features that we calculate:\n",

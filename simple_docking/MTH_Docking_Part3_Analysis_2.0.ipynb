    "# Introduction\n",
    "In Part 2 of your treasure hunt, you obtained poses for your ligand library against a selection of protein conformers. This is a huge amount of data, and to make any sense of it we need to make decisions about which are the \"best\" hits. This is currently a somewhat subjective (and flawed) process, and is the subject of international docking competitions in which research groups attempt to predict experimentally determined protein-ligand complexes, and their affinities (see https://www.capri-docking.org/)."

    "## A few things to think about before we start...\n",
    "\n",
    "## Drug design considerations\n",
    "In drug design programmes, \"fragment hits\" typically have high $\\mu M$ to low $m M$ $K_{i}$ values, where the $K_{i}$ is the equilibrium dissociation constant for the ligand, and represents the probability that the ligand is bound or unbound at a given concentration:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "K_{i}   = \\frac{[L][P]}{[LP]}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "where [L] is the concentration of the ligand, [P] is the concentration of the protein and [LP] is the concentration of the ligand-protein complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fragment hits then need to undergo further chemical refinement to produce a putative drug (e.g. via fragment growth or linking).\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Hit\" compounds tend to be larger molecules that we consider promising and worthy of further structure-activity relationship studies. For these, we might expect $K_{i}$ values in the low $\\mu M$ range. Further along the development pipeline, we have \"lead\" compounds, which may progress to preclinical development. We may expect $K_{i}$ values in the low $n M$ range for these molecules (depending on the target and its tractability).\n",
    "\n",
    "How close do we get in our virtual study???\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why thermodynamics matters\n",
    "One of the major uncertainties is how we interpret our docking scores in terms of a dissociation constant between the protein and the ligand. This is due to the difficulty in calculating thermodynamic properties (which are ensemble averages over around Avogadro's number of molecular entities) from single snapshots obtained by a dock. Moreover, there are additional complications such as induced fit of the receptor, environmental conditions (e.g. salt concentration) and interactions with water. The problem is that what we need for affinity is **free energy**, whereas what we can calculate from a single static protein structure is just the **energy** because the **entropy** term is missing when we don't include all possible protein, ligand and solvent conformations. This is currently impossible to compute. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you find this difficult to understand, you are not alone, and this issue is one of the concepts we explore in our treasure hunt when we consider multiple protein receptor conformations. Vina_BE is in the units of KCal/mol (http://autodock.scripps.edu/faqs-help/faq/how-autodock-4-converts-binding-energy-kcal-mol-into-ki). \n",
    "\n",
    "To convert from Vina_BE to an estimate of the ligand dissociation constant ($K_{i}$), that we call Vina_Ki in this notebook, we use the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "K_{i}   = e^{\\Delta G/RT}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we interpret $\\Delta$G as being equivalent to the Vina_BE, R is the ideal gas constant and T is the temperature. We need the temperature to be in Kelvin (K) and R to be in Kcal/mol/K. Because the $K_{i}$ is a function of the free energy, $\\Delta$G, it tells us about probabilities. For example, a dissociation constant ($K_{i}$) of $10^{-3} M$ means that for each unbound ligand, 1000 are bound to the protein. Conversely, a dissociation constant of $10^{3} M$ means that for each 1000 unbound ligand molecules only one is bound to the protein receptor. Note that below we quote Vina_Ki values in $\\mu M$ because ligand $K_{i}$ values often span the $m M$ to $n M$ range of concentrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "It would also be possible to consider the association constant ($K_{a}$) where:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "K_{a}   = \\frac{1}{K_{i}}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Which of course, from thermodynamics, implies that:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "K_{a}   = e^{-\\Delta G/RT}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "**Generally, all docking scores should be viewed as a rank, rather than a prediction of binding free energy.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**A note on experimental binding assays**: IC$_{50}$ values (the ligand concentration producing a 50% change in an assay) are more prevalent than $K_{i}$ values in the literature because they can be measured in high-throughput experiments, sometimes using liquid handling robotics. An important distinction between $K_{i}$ and IC$_{50}$ is that the latter are assay dependent and affected by, for example, the concentration of the protein and ligand. While equilibrium dissociation constants ($K_{d}$) can be determined using direct binding techniques such as isothermal titration calorimetry, microscale thermophoresis or surface plasmon resonance methods, these methods can be lower throughput and more time consuming."

Pharmaceutical intution suggests that for a compound to engage in a molecular recognition event it must form some **hydrogen bonds** (which are distance and angle dependent interactions) or **electrostatic** interactions with the target, otherwise they will not be sufficiently chemically specific to the binding site. \n",

This is important because how tells you how likely a drug is to cross a cell membrane, which relates to its bioavailability. One of *Lipinski's Rules of 5* is that logP should be no greater than 5 for an orally bioavailable drug. \n",

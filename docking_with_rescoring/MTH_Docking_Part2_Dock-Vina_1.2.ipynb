    "This procedure for understanding the amazing phenomenon of molecular recognition between biomolecules has been designed with a strong agenda. We believe that including the effect of biomolecular dynamics is key to improving our ability to make predictions about how biomolecules will interact. We can see these multiple conformational states either using NMR experiments, or assessing the diversity of X-ray crystal structures, or using theoretical tools such as atomistic molecular dynamics. You will therefore (we hope!!) include a number of protein structures in your \"receptor\" directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "How drugs bind to multiple protein conformations depends upon the underlying physics and chemistry of proteins. In vivo, of course, this will also depend on the environment of the protein - e.g. whether it located in a large complex or in a membrane environment. For molecules to be orally bioavailable drugs, there are more stringent criteria (e.g. Lipinski's rule of 5). \n",
    "\n",
    "Thermal fluctuations (physics) drive conformational changes, but within the constraints imposed by the chemical structure of the proteins and the ligands. The requirement for the drug to reach the target site imposes additional criteria which depends on the physicochemical properties (e.g. clogP). Other considerations, such as the specificity of the compound for it's precise target, it's toxicity (related to specificity), synthetic accessibilty (e.g. can the chemists make it) and ease of formulation (e.g. can this be made into a safe and effective medicine, and is it feasible to make large quantities of it) are essential in practise, and can be non-trivial to overcome.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Enjoy your Treasure Hunt!! Your search space encompasses the vast possibilities offered by the combinatorics of multiple protein conformations and enormous chemical diversity, particularly if you have embarked on a fragment library dock. Your limits imposed by pharmaceutical requirements though, are stringent, and in many ways unknown. Good luck!!   \n",

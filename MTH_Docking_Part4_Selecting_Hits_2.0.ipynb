    "How you decide to proceed depends upon the ligand library you have docked. If you have docked FDA approved drugs, then you have limited chemical freedom to modify these, and your decisions should reflect this. Conversely, if you have docked a fragment library, your chemical opportunities are immense. You are likely to find a strong correlation between Vina_BE and the size of your ligand (e.g. MW or non-H atoms). However, because you want to use your fragment dock to inspire new molecular design, you may be best choosing the most **efficient** fragments (e.g. those with the best ligand efficiency (Vina_LE)), rather than those with the best absolute docking score."
